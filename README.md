Tableau Project

Use ETL/ELT to take raw csv data, transform it into a working set, then load into a SQl database, use Tableau to connect to our own created SQL server to then make multiple dashboards, visualizations, and create stories and then combine with JS/HTML to be publicly viewed.

Zillow: In this presentation we will take Zillow data to visualize privately sold housing options and compare its impact. Measures like home value index, observed rent index, and a list of inventory/listings will all be combined and used to tell visual story that identifies key performance indicators in the housing market.

Craigslist: Craigslist data has been sourced and imported as a collection of privately sold housing options. Region and state data are analyzed with housing options to visualize its overall impact.

Redfin: Redfins real estate brokerage data is used from local multiple listing services data center. We will show visualizations of housing market data, from metropolitan areas, cities, and zip codes across the nation. Manipulations of price, inventory, and sales data has been used to identify trends and highlight relevant findings.

Our rationale is to use this information to be able to make more informed decisions when looking to purchase proprieties, analyze the housing market key performance indicators, and to be able to make informed decisions on what is the most useful information.
